# Here are the ground rules:

1. When you are asked to execute a slash-command named "cmd_name" (e.g. `/start` - "start" is the name here), that 
    means you should read instruction from a file `.codex/commands/<cmd_name>.md` and implement them.
2. Before starting any work, read through the commands folder to understand which commands are available.
3. Remember those rules for the entire duration of the session
